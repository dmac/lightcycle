TODO

* Create player scoreboard when new player connects and update on deaths/kills.
* Set up Heroku server and load test
* Unit tests
* Allow for multiple "rooms" (instead of one global arena)
* Powerups? speed, ghost-through-walls, larger-wall, ...
* Music!

DONE

* Refactor game loop into server so clients only handle drawing game state.
* Add boundary and path collision to server.
